  `Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal is a Public Charitable Trust registered under the Society's Registration Act and Bombay Public Trust Act. From its humble beginnings in 1934, when it took over the Rashtriya Shala, a school established in 1921 in the wake of the National Movement, the Mandal today has grown into a big educational complex imparting high-level education to more than 35,000 students.`,

  `The ethos of the Mandal is marked by patriotic fervor, selfless service, and a spirit of indigenous enterprise. These values permeate all the institutions set up by the Mandal and are the guiding principles for all of them.`,

  `After beginning its journey in the early 1930s, SVKM has blossomed into an educational colossus that has attained national recognition in multiple streams of higher education. With a strong guiding philosophy of providing education to all levels of the student community, SVKM has mastered the art of being able to transform itself into a close-knit family while helping its students achieve all-round development and success.`,

  `Over the past 80 years, the Mandal has developed a large educational complex in Vile Parle, Mumbai, and has spread its wings to metro cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, and Navi Mumbai. SVKM today is proud of some of the finest educational institutes in the country like NMIMS Deemed University, N.M. College of Commerce and Economics, Mithibai College, D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, and Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic — to name a few.`,

  `From its beginnings in the Swadeshi Movement, the Mandal has grown into an educational foundation promoting global thinking consistent with national interest — nurturing values, professionalism, social sensitivity, and dynamic entrepreneurship.`,
